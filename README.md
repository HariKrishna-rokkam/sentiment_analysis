%Sentiment Analysis Project

This repository contains a project focused on sentiment analysis, which classifies textual data as positive, negative, or neutral. The implementation leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction, combined with machine learning models for classification.

% Key Features

Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization to prepare the text for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Implements feature extraction techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or word embeddings.

Model Training: Supports various classifiers including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and deep learning approaches.

Evaluation Metrics: Provides metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

% Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd sentiment-analysis

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

% Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Sentiment\ Analysis.ipynb

Load your dataset in the specified format (e.g., CSV or text file).

Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

Customize the preprocessing or model parameters as needed.

% Dataset

You can use any dataset containing text data and sentiment labels. Ensure the dataset is formatted appropriately (e.g., with columns for text and sentiment labels).

% Applications

This project is suitable for various use cases, including:

Customer feedback analysis

Social media sentiment monitoring

Product review classification
